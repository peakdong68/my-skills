# Implement

Implement the approved spec or tickets without reopening established product or design decisions.

## Authority

You MAY:
- choose local implementation details
- add or update tests
- make small refactors required by the work
- use existing repository patterns and abstractions
- invoke `/diagnosing-bugs` for execution-time failures

You MUST NOT independently:
- change product behavior or scope
- change accepted RFC/ADR decisions
- change public contracts not authorized by the spec
- resolve genuine spec ambiguity by guessing
- add speculative architecture or unrelated cleanup

Choose local implementation details within the approved contract. Inspect the spec, ADRs, code and tests before escalating. Pause only the affected work when an unresolved decision would change product behavior, public contracts, acceptance, compatibility, migration strategy or authorized scope; continue independent authorized work. Do not invoke a user-controlled design skill on the user's behalf without authorization.

## Process

1. Read the governing spec/tickets and relevant ADRs/RFCs; record the starting commit and pre-existing worktree changes.
2. Inspect the affected code and existing test seams.
3. Trace each ticket to the behavior or acceptance criteria it delivers.
4. Implement the smallest coherent change.
5. Use `/tdd` where practical at the pre-agreed seam.
6. Run focused tests and typechecking regularly.
7. If an execution-time bug or unexpected technical failure appears, use `/diagnosing-bugs` and then continue.
8. Run the full relevant test suite once implementation is complete.
9. Once done, use `/code-review`, passing the baseline, spec/tickets and actual change scope, including uncommitted and new files while excluding unrelated user changes.
10. Address blocking review findings within the approved scope.
11. Commit the completed work to the current branch, unless the calling workflow assigns commit ownership to the parent; in that case return the verified changes for parent review and commit.

## Escalation

After inspecting available evidence, pause the affected work when an unresolved decision remains about:
- unclear or changed product intent
- unresolved scope or UX behavior
- an RFC/design decision that must change
- an ADR conflict
- an ambiguous or incorrect spec contract
- a compatibility or migration decision not already established

Report:
- what is blocked
- the conflicting evidence
- which upstream decision appears to own the issue

Do not silently choose a new direction.

## Completion

Implementation is complete when:
- approved scope is implemented
- focused and full relevant tests pass
- typechecking/build checks pass where applicable
- code review has no blocking finding
- no unresolved implementation blocker remains
- the current branch is committed by the designated owner; a worker handoff alone is not end-to-end completion

Implementation completion means **ready for user verification**, not product acceptance.
