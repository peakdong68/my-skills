description: 执行五维度代码审查——正确性、可读性、架构、安全性、性能
---

Invoke the agent-skills:code-review-and-quality skill.

Review the current changes (staged or recent commits) across all five axes:

1. **Correctness** — Does it match the spec? Edge cases handled? Tests adequate?
2. **Readability** — Clear names? Straightforward logic? Well-organized?
3. **Architecture** — Follows existing patterns? Clean boundaries? Right abstraction level?
4. **Security** — Input validated? Secrets safe? Auth checked? (Use security-and-hardening skill)
5. **Performance** — No N+1 queries? No unbounded ops? (Use performance-optimization skill)

Categorize findings as Critical, Important, or Suggestion.
Output a structured review with specific file:line references and fix recommendations.
