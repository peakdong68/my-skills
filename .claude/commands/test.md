description: 运行测试驱动开发 (TDD) 工作流——编写失败测试、实现代码、验证。对于 Bug，使用“证明它” (Prove-It) 模式。
---

Invoke the agent-skills:test-driven-development skill.

For new features:

1. Write tests that describe the expected behavior (they should FAIL)
2. Implement the code to make them pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

For bug fixes (Prove-It pattern):

1. Write a test that reproduces the bug (must FAIL)
2. Confirm the test fails
3. Implement the fix
4. Confirm the test passes
5. Run the full test suite for regressions

For browser-related issues, also invoke agent-skills:browser-testing-with-devtools to verify with Chrome DevTools MCP.
